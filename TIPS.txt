Helpful Tips for hey-shoot Scripts
===================================
1. Don't put spaces around "=".

2. Put spaces around "[" and "]". Bash is really weird :/

3. Put quotes around ALL paths that uses bash variables.

4. https://www.shellcheck.net/ is your friend. Use it to your advantage!

5. Use "hey [APP] getsuites" to get the properties/items on the app.

6. Keep in mind that some apps require a revert to default settings before screenshot.
   In this case, you should:
     * Backup your settings file to the "tmp" directory included in this repo.
     * Revert settings on the app. Close app. The app's "settings" file should updated.
     * Copy this settings file to the "workdir" directory. Rename to "[app].default-settings".
     
   Now, you should add some commands that copy the user's settings file to "tmp",
   copy the default settings to the settings directory, take a screenshot of the app,
   and restore the user's settings into the settings directory.
   Please also remove the user settings from the "tmp" directory.
   
   You are welcome to look at the example scripts in the "scripts" directory :)
   
7. Add your scripts to the "scripts" directory.
